# FakeChrome
This software uses Bat To Exe Converter to convert bat files to exe files.

If you want to change the content yourself, you can edit the bat file and then use Bat To Exe Converter to convert it to an exe file (if you just want to change the icon icon, you can use Resource Hacker, which is easier to change).

This software is only for Winsows system; Linux, Mac OS and other systems are not considered to be launched.
